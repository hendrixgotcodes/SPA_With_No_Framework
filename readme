Basic Building Blocks Of An SPA

1. Router
    -Responsible for manipulating the DOM (Often showing and hiding)
    -Handles user links and navigation inside the application
    -Updates URL bar, page titles (can be done through event listening of the url)

2. HTTP Library(Optional if you won't communicate with back-end)
    -Responsible for communication with the back-end of your application

3. State Manager
    -Throughout the lifespan of the SPA data such as volume levels, video points and even window sizes are to be saved
    this is the job of the state manager. The Redux library can help do that.


4. UI Layer
    -Literally anything the user sees, from textboxes, through buttons, forms and etc.
